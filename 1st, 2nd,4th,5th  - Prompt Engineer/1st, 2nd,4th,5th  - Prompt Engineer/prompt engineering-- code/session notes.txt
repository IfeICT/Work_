Welcome to PROMPT ENGINEERING workshop -->

1- prompt engineering session is going to 
		theory -- CONCEPT OF PE 
		prcticle -- APPLY IN PRACTICLE 

2- PRAKASH SENAPATI 
	LINKEDIN ( K.PRAKASH SENPATI)
	NIT - 4YR

3- THEORY IS VERY IMPORTATN
	1VIDEO MAKES YOU EXPERT about PE 
=================
4- WHAT IS PROMPT ENGINEERING ?
	- new domain
	- most of them know about AI earlier
	- chatgpt many user used gpt every min 
	- entire world used gpt everyone started reserch how chatgpt 
	- Back bone of chatgpt is GENERATIVE AI 
frontend - chatgpt ( user enter any question prompt)
backend model -- llm model 

 gen ai has mainly 2 aspect 
	Training data -  OPEN AI TRAIN THE data(API KEY)
		clean, no noise, no hallucinat, bias, politcs
	Input to the input -- user can do 

open ai api key -- not a free version it is paid version 
	user enter any question to the prompt
		chargable ($5)
	every token open ai charge some amount
	
most of the time user must need to right valid prompt to 
generate accuracte output 

	llm model train from internet, books, web, xml, article, research, github docum,etc
 no user can train the way open ai api does 
 
 training part -- we dont have
 but right promput -- user must do this 
 
 ask a question such way less token model should generate appropriate answer.
=====================
2- why to learn prompt engineer ?

	- evolving domain -- 1yr back 
	- brand new domain 
	- 5 days - gpt conusume 1 million user 
	
	Job opening --> 2025 (good growth)
	
	Every company wanted to hire at 2-3 dev for research
	looking for fresher intern in PE job role

	not required any experience
	apply prompt engineer 
	carrer gap -- some experience 
====================
3- LLM MODEL SETTING
	 CLICK TO IT -- PLATFORM.OPENAI.COM
     LOGIN TO IT -- PLAYGROUND 

- MODEL -- USER SELCT MODEL BASED ON USER REQUIRE1- 
	3.5 MODEL | 4 MODEL
***	
-TEMP -- (0 - 2)
	Temperature will decide how model the more creative.
	generate accurate rate
 if randomness is high -- error also higg 
	midius -- midium
 
 should be low -- so randomess would be les produce accuracy text conten 
***
-top-p -- 
 
temp + top- p 
low temp + low p value -- accura text response 
***
---
coherent response -->
---
A coherent piece of text or speech effectively communicates its message in a way that is
easy for others to understand.
***
max-length -- code has to genen 1000 
***
stop sequence -- controlss output 
help to stop irrelanvant mesage for query which asked by user
***
frequency penaly & presence penalty -->
***
 main use of fp -- reduce repition
 avoid repeating words 

range fp - 0 to 2 
	0 - model can produce repeat words
	> 0 -- higher penaly not produce repeat words

presence penalty -- generate text 
f 0 means there is no penalty for using previously mentioned words

====================	
4- prompt elements -->

	instruction - write the summary of algortihm 
	context -- in the contex of climate change
	example 
	tone & style - 
	format- list of items, write the paragraph,use bullet point 
	length - in 100 words, 1000 words
	constraint -- these above prompt element would help 
		any user to produce coherent respone from the model 
====================
5- prompt engineering technique (shot tecnique in prompt 

zero shot learning  -- never seen the data ( existing knowledge ) 
one shot learning -- you give only 1 exampl produce the o/p
few shot learning -- you not 1 but you give multiple picture 

project if you have multiple object -- use few shot leanring
project one object -- use one shot learning 
project dont object -- zero shot learning 

===================
6- COT PROMPT ( CHAIN OF THOUGHTS)

many problem 
	 to get solution of the problem -- shall we use 
		different way different way to solve the problem
chain of thought
		problem -- step by step approach 
			
 brak down all tokeens from the query 
 every token need to under provide accurac answer
 

0 shot cot -- model produce responce without example less clarity 
1 shot cot -- Provides a single guiding example for better clarity and coherence.
few shot cot - Best for complex tasks, offering multiple examples to enhance
understanding and accuracy.

==========================
7- self consistency in prompt engineering -->

user ask same question to the promput multiple time
	if model produce multiple respone -- not good model 
--	
how we overcome this issue --
--	
	clarity promput
	fine tune 
	multiple test
	guide thr promput with few shot & 1 shot 

==========================
8- OUT OF DATE LEANRING IN PROMPT ENGINEERING 

	GPT 3 --> 31st dec 23 ( future data not trained )
	GPT 3.5 turbo --> 31st dec 24
	GPT 4
	GEMINI PRO
	GEMINI FALSH 

fixed knowledge cutof
static -- fixed ( dynammic - changes)
Once trained, the model doesn't automatically update its
knowledge. 

you need to fine tune with new data -
	every open ai  -- new model 
		gemin - 
		meta 

llm models not uptodate -- give you misinformation 

mitigation outdated response 

strategies to addre out of data 
	as of 2021 -- generate only 21 yr data
		never get misinformation from the prompt 
	
regular updates -- 
cross verification -- 

out-of-date learning is crucial in prompt engineering. 
==================
9- ROLE PLAYING IN PROMPT ENGINEER -->

	HOW TO ENTER EFFECTIIVE PROMPUT
		YOU CAN ACT AS INTERVI

how user write the query use gpt as you friend
=================
10- RAG in prompt engineering 

	retreival 
	augument 
	generation 
rag always intergrate to the vector datase

	complany has few doc -- doc will stoe in vector 
				from ( embedding concept)
	user -- query -- ask question about pdf
		user question also store in vector form
	lllm model retreve & generate semanitic information of the query

model not produce accuracy information -- fine tune it 

==============
11- REACT IN PROMPT ENGINEERING -->
	REASON + ACT 

The REACT framework in prompt engineering emphasizes a structured approach to
interactive scenarios, combining reasoning, engagement, and actionable insights. 

================
12- DSP 
=========
THEORY WE ARE COMPLETED 
========
OPEN AI API KEY 

GEMININ & META OPEN AI IS VERY POWER LLM 

	OPEN AI IS NOT FREE 
WE NEED -- 5$  
========
PROMPT ENGINEERING PRACTICLE -->
---	
1 - PLATFORM.OPENAI.COM
2- LOGIN TO OPEN AI USING GMAIL ID 
3- YOUR PROFILE - CREATE NEW API KEY - IT WILL NOT WORK 
	OPEN AI STOP PROVIDIEN FREE ACCESS FROM MAY 2023 
4- BILLING - PAYMENT METHODS - SAFE AMOUNT 
	INTERNATION DEBIT CARD ( DO NOT GIVE CREDIT CARD)
5- API KEY - NEW SECRET KEY -- COPY -- PAST & SAVE THE KEY FOR ANY PRACTICLE IN OPENAI 
6- DASHBOARD - USAGE - CHECK YOU HOW MUCH AMOUTN YOU HAVE IN YOU OPEN AI BALANCE
7- how to login and get paid api key if you are new user
